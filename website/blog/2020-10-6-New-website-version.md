The V1 arrived with many evolutions, both on the framework and on the website!

## Dark Theme

The most important evolution of this new version is the addition of a native dark mode to the framework. This is the point that was the most important to me. It seems inconceivable to me today to develop an interface without thinking about the dark mode. Thus, all the `<html>` elements have been designed to be perfectly displayed in a light or dark mode. To complete this evolution, a change of mode has also been developed in order to make it easier to use.

> For more informations about dark theme, consult the dedicated [page](/docs/dark).

## What's new in this version?

One new item has been added ([browser](/docs/browser)), some others have new features, and several patches have been added. This allows to complete the range of elements proposed by minstyle.io, and to perpetuate the existing one.

## And on the website?

The website now has a [blog](/blog), which will allow you to share with you the major evolutions of the framework, but also various information related to it that might interest you.

A search bar has been added thanks to [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/)'s support on this project. This one allows to search any content on the website, in order to facilitate the navigation.

In addition, it is now possible to consult the documentation of a specific version. To do so, just click on the version number at the top left, to get to a [dedicated page](versions) listing all the versions, then you just have to choose which one you are interested in.

Finally, the formatting of the elements has been slightly modified. Now the content is highlighted in a virtual browser, as for the alert below:

<div class="ms-browser">
    <div class="ms-tab-browser">
        <div class="ms-dot red"></div>
        <div class="ms-dot yellow"></div>
        <div class="ms-dot green"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="ms-content">
        <div class="ms-alert">
            <span class="ms-close"></span>
            <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit...</p>
        </div>
    </div>
</div><br/>

More developments will happen in the coming months, stay tuned ;)
