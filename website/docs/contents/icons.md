The minstyle.io framework does not have its own icon set. 

The set of icons used on the minstyle.io documentation are mainly from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/). Of course, it is possible to integrate your own icon collection, or one of the following alternatives :

* [Feather](https://feathericons.com)
* [Octicons](https://primer.style/octicons/)
* [Icons8](https://icons8.com)
* [Material Design Icons](https://material.io/icons/)
* [Ionicons](https://ionicons.com/)
* [Foundation Icons](https://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/icons.html)
* [IcoMoon](https://icomoon.io/)
