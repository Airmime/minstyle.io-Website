minstyle.io integrates the management of the dark mode. **Each HTML element is designed to be displayed in both light and dark mode**.

In order to allow users to control the display mode, the [dark-mode-switcher](https://github.com/Airmime/dark-mode-switcher) package has been developed to fully integrate with minstyle.io. This package proposes a javascript injecting on the web page a fixed button, allowing to change mode, as it is the case on the whole minstlyle.io website.

> The default mode will be the one set on the user's system. If the display mode is changed, a cookie is placed on the browser to store this information.

> The [dark-mode-switcher](https://github.com/Airmime/dark-mode-switcher) is optional, you can develop your own script modifying the `<html>` tag.

## How it works

First, the script will inject on your web page an HTML structure, allowing to display a fixed button. It will allow the user to change the Dark/Light display mode.

By default, the theme displayed will be the one set on the operating system. Nevertheless, if the user wishes to change the display mode, a cookie will be created in order to keep this choice.

Changing the display mode changes the data-theme attribute of the `<html>` tag like that :

```html
<html lang="en">
  <!-- For light mode. same as : <html lang="en" data-theme="light"> -->
  <html lang="en" data-theme="dark">
    <!-- For dark mode. -->
  </html>
</html>
```
