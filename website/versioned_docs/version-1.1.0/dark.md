minstyle.io integrates the management of the dark mode. **Each HTML element is designed to be displayed in both light and dark mode**.

In order to allow users to control the display mode, the [dark-mode-switcher](https://github.com/Airmime/dark-mode-switcher) package has been developed to fully integrate with minstyle. This package proposes a javascript injecting on the web page a fixed button, allowing to change mode, as it is the case on the whole minstlyle.io website.

>The default mode will be the one set on the user's system. If the display mode is changed, a cookie is placed on the browser to store this information.
