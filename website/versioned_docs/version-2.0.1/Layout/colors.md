The framework is based on the use of four colors. They are all customizable through the use of the [generator](generator.md), so that you can make the framework your own.

Thus, all the elements composing the framework can call the `.ms-primary`, `.ms-secondary`, `.ms-action` and `.ms-action2` class, which will have the effect of modifying their appearance (often by changing the color of the element, or of a part of the element).

**.ms-primary**: The primary color of the framework. This should define the main color of your design.

**.ms-secondary**: The secondary color of the framework. This should define the secondary color of your design, matching the primary color.

**.ms-action**: This color is used to highlight the HTML elements calling for an action. It can also be a complementary color to your design.

**.ms-action2**: This color complements the first action color. It too can complement the design.
